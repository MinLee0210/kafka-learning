---

**Goal:**  
Introduce the problem, explain why Kafka is useful in AI/computer vision pipelines, and guide the reader through setting up Kafka and a basic producer.

## Schema

### 1. Introduction
- Real-time data in computer vision
- Why Kafka? (Scalability, decoupling, streaming)

### 2. Kafka Basics
